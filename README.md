Student Exam Performance Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts student exam scores based on demographic and educational features, with a web interface for interactive predictions.

ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project combines machine learning with a frontend web application:

Backend (ML): Uses a regression model to predict student exam performance based on features like gender, parental education, lunch type, test preparation, and previous scores.

Frontend: A responsive HTML form to input student data and get real-time predictions.

âš¡ Features

Predict student exam performance using multiple ML models:

Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree

XGBoost, CatBoost, AdaBoost, Linear Regression

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

Save and load trained models with Pickle.

Interactive Flask web interface.

Stylish single-page frontend with HTML & CSS.

Display predicted results instantly.
